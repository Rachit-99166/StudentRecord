# STUDENT RECORD

# Overview

Developed a student data management website using Spring Boot, MySQL, Java, Git, Postman, Bootstrap, and JUnit to efficiently store and manage student records. The platform features a user-friendly interface for form-based input, backend integration with a relational database, and robust testing support. This system was effectively used during Tech Club events to track student participation, improving coordination and simplifying data handling for organizers.

# How it works

The website can be easily set up by cloning or forking the repository, then simply clicking the "Run" button in an IDE or using the mvn spring-boot:run command. Once running, it opens a local web interface where users can fill out a form with student details like name, email, phone number, gender, date, and time.
